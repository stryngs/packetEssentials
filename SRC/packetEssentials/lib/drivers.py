        Any portion of notdecoded could have been chosen for the offset, but
        after careful examination of multiple frames, it was determined that
        the frequency should be used as the offset point.  The reason behind
        this being that the things of most interest are closest to the
        frequency from a left to right perspective, bytewise.
        
        This offset is determined by taking packet.notdecoded and turning it
        into a list of bytes.  This is done by the following:
        notDecoded = hexstr(str(packet.notdecoded), onlyhex=1).split(' ')
        
        The list of bytes is then used as an offset based on the last byte of
        the frequency.  As an example, 2.447 GHz will be used.
        
        Bytewise 2447 is represented as 0x8f09.  Due to the way the IEEE deals
        with certain aspects of 802.11, we have to Little Endian this,
        thus 0x098f when converted to Decimal becomes 2447.
        
        Looking at this type of frame in Wireshark with the ath9k or ath9k_htc
        driver would yield the 09 byte in question as the 20th byte from left
        to right.  Thus, in list form using a zero index Python wise, we
        ascertain the offset to be that of 19.

        Capturing a Beacon in Scapy for PCAP consumption goes something like:
        pkt = sniff(iface = 'wlan0mon',
                    count = 1,
                    lfilter = lambda x: x[Dot11].type == 0 and\
                                        x[Dot11].subtype == 8)
        wrpcap('beacon.pcap', pkt)
        
        As of right now, this list is very small.  If you wish to contribute,
        please contact via a Github Issue with the type of driver you have and
        the offset associated with it.
        
        Research is underway right now to figure out how to best deal with the
        obstacle found when dealing with an Alfa AWUS036-NEH.  In a current
        version of Kali, it lists the driver as being an rt2800usb.  Previous
        testing with a non NEH using that driver found the offset to be 11.
        
        .notdecoded iwlwifi example:                                                                                             [--HERE--]    
        ['20', '08', '00', 'a0', '20', '08', '00', '00', '10', '41', '6f', '79', '01', '00', '00', '00', '10', '02', '99', '09', 'a0', '00', 'd8', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '00', '51', '40', '6f', '79', '00', '00', '00', '00', '16', '00', '11', '03', 'd8', '00', 'ce', '01']
        
        .notdecoded rt2800usb-NEH example:
                     [--HERE--]  4th bit ([3] as this is a list) for .notdecoded and 12th bit all together
        ['00', '02', '6c', '09', 'a0', '00', 'dd', '01', '00', '00']
        
        The dirty patch I'm doing is just to adjust accordingly, but what is
        curious to know is what else is not there in .notdecoded for the NEH
